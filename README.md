## Tasks

The usual tasks can be performed using GNU make. The `Makefile` defines a target for each task. To execute a task, the name of the task must be specified as an argument to the make command.

```bash
make taskname
```

## Development Environment

We use [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/) to provide a reproducible development environment. We recommend that you do the same. In this way, it is guaranteed that the appropriate version of the tools required for development will be available.
